# HCI2 SiS

**HCI2 SiS** is our project for HCI2. It consists of a redesigned SiS portal that aims to replace the current one. The one that the school uses at the moment, is slow and feels cluttered according to a survey we conducted. With this project we aim to make the process of registering and getting important information via SiS easy for everyone including staff.
